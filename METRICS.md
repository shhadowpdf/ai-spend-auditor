## North Star: Qualified Leads per Week

**Definition:** A user who (a) completed an audit, (b) submitted their email, and (c)
was flagged by the system as identifying ≥ $500/month in potential savings
(`AUDIT_HIGH_SAVINGS_MONTHLY_THRESHOLD`).

**Why this and not something else:**

Credex is a B2B lead-generation tool, not a consumer app. "Users" and "audits" are
vanity unless they produce a pipeline. A completed audit with no email is a free
product delivery with zero business value. An email with no savings flag is a tire-
kicker. Only the intersection of *completion + contact + high intent signal* predicts
revenue.

DAU is explicitly not the North Star. Startups legitimately run one audit per quarter
when they're reviewing budgets. A founder who ran Credex in January and saved $600/month
is a success story — not a churn event because they didn't come back in February. Forcing
a retention lens onto a tool with a natural quarterly cadence will drive you toward
artificial engagement features that don't close deals.

At the current stage — pre-revenue, pre-instrumentation — this metric is the only one
that tells you whether the funnel is working end-to-end.

## Three Input Metrics

### 1. Audit Completion Rate
**Definition:** (Audits completed) ÷ (Audits started)  
**Target:** ≥ 15%  
**Why it matters:** The gap between "started" and "completed" is pure UX friction. A low
rate here means the form is too long, the tool catalogue is confusing, or the pricing
inputs feel risky. This is fixable without changing the business model. Track by step
to find exactly where users abandon.

### 2. Email Capture Rate on High-Savings Audits
**Definition:** (Emails submitted) ÷ (Audits completed where savings ≥ $500/month)  
**Target:** ≥ 35%  
**Why it matters:** When the tool surfaces real money — $600, $800, $1,200/month — users
who *still* don't leave an email are saying something. Either they don't trust Credex
with their contact, or the CTA at the end of the report isn't compelling enough. This
rate is a direct proxy for trust and copy quality at the moment of maximum intent.

### 3. Audit-to-Consultation Booked Rate
**Definition:** (Consultations booked via follow-up email) ÷ (Qualified leads in the
same cohort, lagged 7 days)  
**Target:** ≥ 25%  
**Why it matters:** This is where lead value converts to revenue. A drop here signals a
problem in the outbound sequence — wrong timing, wrong tone, or the lead went cold.
It's the handoff between the product and the sales motion.

## What to Instrument First

The funnel has four steps. None of them are currently tracked end-to-end (per
`ECONOMICS.md`: *"Instrumentation is the most valuable thing to build in week 2"*).
Instrument in this order:

1. **Audit started** — log a `audit.started` event with a session ID the moment the
   user begins the form. This is the denominator for everything else.
2. **Audit completed + savings amount** — log `audit.completed` with the total savings
   figure. This unlocks Completion Rate and the high-savings flag.
3. **Email submitted** — log `lead.captured` with the savings tier
   (standard / high-savings). This is the North Star numerator.
4. **Shareable link created** — log `share.created`. This tracks the viral loop; every
   shared link is a potential zero-CAC acquisition event.

Do not instrument page views or return visits yet. They are noise at this stage.

## Pivot Trigger

**If, after 200 completed audits, qualified leads per week is < 2.**

Two per week across 200 completions is a 5% email capture rate on high-savings users —
far below the 35% target. At that rate, the funnel produces roughly one client every
three months at current close rates. That is not a business.

At that point, the question is: where is it breaking?

- If completion rate is < 10%: the product has a UX problem. Fix the form before
  changing the model.
- If completion rate is fine but email capture is < 15%: the trust or copy problem is
  downstream of the audit. Test a stronger end-of-report CTA or a value-first email
  offer (e.g., "We'll do a 15-min Loom walkthrough of your results").
- If both are fine but consultations don't book: the sales motion is broken, not the
  product. The pivot is operational, not strategic.

200 audits is achievable in 2–3 weeks from a single Show HN post. That is the earliest
point at which a data-driven pivot decision is possible.
