# Economics

All inputs below are estimates. Where a number is uncertain, the assumption is stated
explicitly. Approximate numbers > no numbers.

## Revenue Model Assumption

Credex monetises by converting the free audit tool into consulting engagements.
The tool is top-of-funnel. Revenue has two components:

| Component | Price | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation consultation (one-time) | $1,500 | One-off |
| Ongoing monitoring retainer | $400 / month | Avg. 5 months |
| **Blended LTV per client** | **$3,500** | |

*Rationale: seed-stage startups have real budget ($500–$5k/month in AI tools) but no
internal procurement. A $1,500 one-time fee to save $800/month is a 2-month payback,
which is an easy sell. Retainer churn is high at this company stage — 5 months is
conservative.*

## What Is a Converted Lead Worth?

**Lead** = a user who completed an audit AND submitted their email.

```
Lead → consultation booked:     25%
Consultation → paying client:   50%
Lead → paying client:           12.5%

Lead value = 12.5% × $3,500 LTV = $437.50
```

**High-savings lead** (identified ≥ $500/month in savings — flagged by the
`AUDIT_HIGH_SAVINGS_MONTHLY_THRESHOLD` env var in the codebase):

```
Higher intent → higher close rate: 30%
Lead → paying client:             30% × 50% = 15%

High-savings lead value = 15% × $3,500 = $525
```

## CAC by Channel

No paid budget. Founder time is costed at **$50/hour** (opportunity cost proxy).

| Channel | Hours/month | Estimated clients/month | Time-based CAC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Show HN post (one-time) | 4 hrs | 2 (burst) | **$100** |
| X reply hunting (10 replies/day) | 20 hrs | 1.5 | **$667** |
| Reddit posts (r/ExperiencedDevs, r/SaaS) | 6 hrs | 0.75 | **$400** |
| Discord drops (Cursor, AI Engineer) | 4 hrs | 0.5 | **$400** |
| YC cold email (20 targets/batch) | 4 hrs | 0.5 | **$400** |
| Viral audit links (zero incremental effort) | 0 hrs | 0.5 | **$0** |

**Blended CAC (months 1–3):** ~$420

**Blended CAC (months 6+):** drops to ~$200 as referrals and shared audit links
compound. Each audit link that gets posted publicly is a zero-cost acquisition event.

## Conversion Funnel to Profitability

```
Visitors              →  100%
Audit started         →   20%   (low friction; no signup)
Audit completed       →   15%   (form is multi-step; some drop mid-way)
Email submitted       →   10%   (optional; not all users want follow-up)
Consultation booked   →   25%   (of email leads; triggered by high-savings flag)
Paying client         →   50%   (of consultations)

Visitor → paying client:  0.15 × 0.10 × 0.25 × 0.50 = 0.19%
Revenue per visitor:      0.0019 × $3,500 = $6.65
```

**Break-even visitors for $3,500 client:**
```
$3,500 / $6.65 ≈ 527 visitors to acquire one paying client
```

At $420 blended CAC and $3,500 LTV:
```
Gross margin per client:  $3,500 − $420 = $3,080  (88%)
Payback period:           < 1 month (cash upfront for consultation)
```

The unit economics are strong because CAC is time, not media spend, and the
infrastructure cost is near zero (Supabase free tier, Groq free tier, Resend free
tier = ~$0/month until meaningful scale).

## What Would Have to Be True for $1M ARR in 18 Months

**Target:** $1,000,000 ARR = $83,333 MRR

### Model A — Retainer-Heavy (more realistic)
```
ACV:          $4,800/year ($400/month × 12)
Clients needed for $1M ARR: 1,000,000 / 4,800 ≈ 209 active retainer clients

To reach 209 active clients by month 18, assuming 5-month avg retention:
  → Need ~42 new clients/month by month 12 (ramp from 0)
  → Avg across 18 months: ~25 new clients/month

At 12.5% lead → client conversion:
  → Need 200 leads/month = 2,000 audits/month = 13,333 visitors/month

13k visitors/month by month 6–9 is achievable IF:
  (a) Show HN drives 400–800 visitors in week 1
  (b) Shared audit links generate 0.3 new audits per audit on average (viral coefficient)
  (c) 2–3 picked-up case studies drive inbound spikes
```

**Verdict:** Possible, but requires the viral loop from shared audit links to actually
work. Without it, 13k organic visitors/month is a content marketing problem and
arrives in month 18, not month 6.

---

### Model B — Higher ACV Per Client (requires a sales motion)
```
ACV:          $12,000/year ($1,000/month retainer or $8k one-time + $4k retainer)
Clients needed: 1,000,000 / 12,000 ≈ 84 active clients

New clients/month needed: ~5–6 by month 12
At 12.5% lead → client: 40–50 leads/month = 400–500 audits/month = 2,500–3,000 visitors/month

3k visitors/month is achievable within 90 days from organic channels.
```

**Verdict:** $1M ARR in 18 months is realistic under Model B — but only if Credex can
close at $12k ACV consistently, which requires a sales call, a champion inside the
company, and proof of savings that justifies the fee. The tool already generates the
proof; the missing piece is a repeatable sales motion after the audit.

### What Must Be True (Regardless of Model)

| Assumption | Required value | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Audit completion rate | ≥ 15% of visitors | Achievable; form is low-friction |
| Email capture rate | ≥ 10% of completions | Achievable; optional email field exists |
| Consultation close rate | ≥ 40% | Requires polished follow-up sequence; not yet built |
| Viral coefficient | ≥ 0.2 new audits per shared link | Shareable link is built; needs real sharing data |
| ACV | ≥ $5,000 | Requires a defined pricing page and sales playbook |
| Churn | ≤ 15%/month on retainer | Requires demonstrable ongoing value beyond the one-time audit |

The tool is built. The funnel instrumentation (tracking audit → email → booked
consultation) is not built yet. Without that, the conversion numbers above are
unverifiable guesses. **Instrumentation is the most valuable thing to build in week 2.**
