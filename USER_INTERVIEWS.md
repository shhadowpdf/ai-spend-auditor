# User Interviews

Three conversations conducted with college students actively paying for AI tools.
Each was ~10–12 minutes, done informally over chat/in-person.

---

## Interview 1 — E.S.T.

**Role:** Final-year CS student  
**Tools:** Cursor Pro ($20/mo), ChatGPT Go ($8/mo) — $28/month total  
**Duration:** ~11 minutes

### Notes

E.S.T. uses Cursor Pro primarily for assignments and side projects. Added ChatGPT Go
a few months ago because she felt Cursor's chat wasn't great for explaining concepts —
she wanted something she could have a back-and-forth with outside the editor.

**Quotes:**
> "I know I'm paying for both but they kind of do different things for me. Cursor is
> for when I'm actually writing code. ChatGPT is more like... when I need something
> explained or I'm stuck on a concept."

> "₹2,000 a month is a lot for a student. I justify it because it saves me hours, but
> I'd definitely switch if I could get the same thing cheaper."

> "I never thought about whether Cursor already does what ChatGPT does for me. Probably
> does, actually."

**Most surprising thing:** She had never compared the two tools for overlap. When I
walked through what Cursor Pro's chat can do, she paused and said "wait, I might just
be paying for the same thing twice." She hadn't audited her own stack in her head, even
though she knew the individual prices.

**What it changed about the design:** The results page now needed to call out
*functional overlap* between tools, not just cost alternatives. Showing "cheaper
plan exists" is less valuable than showing "you are paying for two tools that cover
the same use case." Added this to the backlog as a priority feature.

## Interview 2 — N.Y.

**Role:** 3rd-year engineering student, building a freelance client project  
**Tools:** ChatGPT Go ($8/mo), Claude Pro ($17/mo) — $25/month total  
**Duration:** ~10 minutes

### Notes

N.Y. started with ChatGPT Go and added Claude specifically because a client project
required longer document drafting and he found ChatGPT's context window wasn't holding
up. Uses them for genuinely different tasks and was resistant to the idea of consolidating.

**Quotes:**
> "ChatGPT is faster for quick things. Claude is better when I need it to actually
> think through something long. I've tried doing everything on one and it doesn't work."

> "I know the total is 25 a month. That's fine right now because I'm billing the client.
> But when this project ends, honestly, one of them is going."

> "If someone showed me a plan that did both properly I'd switch immediately. But I
> don't think that exists."

**Most surprising thing:** He had already mentally planned to drop one tool when the
freelance project ended — which means his current two-tool setup is *intentionally
temporary*. He wasn't overspending out of ignorance; he had made a deliberate
cost-benefit call and had an exit plan. This was the most self-aware response of the
three.

**What it changed about the design:** The audit result shouldn't always frame
multi-tool usage as inefficiency. N.Y.'s case is legitimate. Added a consideration
to the design backlog: if use-cases across tools are *non-overlapping*, the
recommendation should acknowledge that, not just push consolidation.

## Interview 3 — N.K.

**Role:** 2nd-year student, uses AI mainly for studying and writing assignments  
**Tools:** ChatGPT Go ($8/mo), Gemini AI Plus ($7.99/mo) — ~$16/month total  
**Duration:** ~12 minutes

### Notes

N.K. is on the two cheapest paid plans and is still uncomfortable with the combined
cost. Signed up for Gemini because Google One bundled storage with it and he needed
the storage more than the AI. The AI was almost incidental.

**Quotes:**
> "I took Gemini because of the storage honestly. The AI is okay, I use it sometimes.
> ChatGPT I use more."

> "₹1,300 a month doesn't sound like much but I'm a student. If I could cut it to
> ₹800 and get the same work done I would."

> "I wouldn't share my audit publicly. Like, people would judge me for spending on
> this stuff. I'd maybe send it to a friend privately if they were asking about the
> same tools."

**Most surprising thing:** He's paying for Gemini primarily for Google Drive storage,
not for AI. The AI is a side effect. This means the "monthly spend" he reports on a
tool like Gemini is not purely AI spend — it's bundled utility. An audit tool that
treats his $7.99 as "AI cost" is technically wrong about what he's actually buying.

**What it changed about the design:** The audit form should probably ask *why* a user
is on a plan, not just which plan they're on. A "primary use case" or "how often do
you use this?" field would let the engine weight recommendations more accurately.
Currently the engine assumes all spend is intentional AI usage — N.K.'s case shows
that's not always true.
